# FoodForAll
Around the world, more than 800 million people go to bed hungry every day. That is roughly one in every 10 people remain hungry in the globe.Hunger still remains one of the biggest problems in the world.
Greatest paradox to above is the Food wastage. Roughly one third of food produced in the world for human consumption every year gets lost or wasted. The amount of food lost or wasted every year is equivalent to more than half of the world's annual cereals crop (2.3 billion tonnes in 2009/2010). Food losses and waste amounts to roughly US$ 680 billion in industrialized countries and US$ 310 billion in developing countries.
